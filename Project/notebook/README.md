# Notebook structure

#### `Project_main_notebook.ipynb:`
This is the main notebook of our project, which contains all the data processing ,analysis, research and final conclusion parts.

#### `Import_initial_data.ipynb:`
This notebook contains the data loading and pickle files generation process. As our initial datasets are quite large, we donâ€™t think it is a good choice to put this part in our main notebook.

#### `Explanation_for_modifications.ipynb:`
This notebook show the whole process that we did to be familiar with our initially chosen datasets and the explanation of the modifications in terms of our research questions.
